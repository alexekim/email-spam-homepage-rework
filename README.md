basic test: just adapted pseudocode to see how things work

livetest: adapting it to a page that is already live on lung.org

viewmodel: where the actual working code will live.


ISSUES:

focus() and click() are not working on the inputs. thus, a second action is required.

setTimeout to check for useractivity and then automatically change the form is set. questionable whether this will actually deter bots or not.
